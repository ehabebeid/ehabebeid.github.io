           <h1 class="w3-text">Il Campidoglio</h1>
           <p>The Capitoline (Italian: <span class="italic">Campidoglio</span>) is the smallest of the hills of Rome, lying on the western extreme of the Roman Forum. Once a natural fortress with a citadel, and a site of important religious functions in the ancient period, it became the city's civic centre and the seat of its government in the medieval period, such that to this date the hill's name is associated with the city government.</p>

           <p>The Hill was not only transformed in terms of its main functions: it also lost much of its original shape and orientation through its transformation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and since the construction of the Victor Emmanuel II monument in the early twentieth century (Claridge 229-232).</p>

           <h3 class="w3-text">Ancient Period: Temples and Citadel</h3>
           <p>The Capitoline in ancient times was an easily defensible hill consisting of two crests: the northern one, the <span class="italic">Arx</span>, was smaller and slightly higher. Separating the two was a saddle called the <span class="italic">asylum</span>, which, according to legend Romulus, declared a sanctuary for refugees, in the course of founding his new city (Claridge 230). Of the two summits of the Hill, the southern one is what was more properly referred to as <span class='italic'>Capitolium</span> (Coarelli 41), and houses some of the city's most important religious functions, including many temples. Most important of these was the <a href="jupiter.html">Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline</a>, surrounded by the sacred <span class="italic">area Capitolina</span>. Other temples and shrines on the southern end of the Hill included those to Fides and Ops. Archaeological record shows that there were multiples temples whose roofs were clad with gilded bronze tiles (Krautheimer 12).</p>
           
           <p>On the northern crest of the Hill stood the Arx, the citadel founded upon the natural fortress, corresponding now with the location of the <a href="smaracoeli.html">Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli</a>. The Arx held the <span class="italic">Auguraculum</span>, a place where omens were read in the flight of birds. It also housed the Temple of Juno Moneta. Tradition lists this temple as the location of the first mint in the Republican period, which gives many European languages their words for 'money'.</p>
           
           <p>On the eastern slope of the Hill, facing the Roman Forum, was the <a href="tabularium.html">Tabularium</a>, the official records building of the Imperial period.</p>
           
           <h3 class="w3-text">From the Medieval to the Renaissance</h3>
           
           <p>In the medieval period, the Capitoline lay on the eastern edge on the <span class="italic">abitato</span>, or the inhabited centre, and was for the most part neglected. Radical transformations came, however, in the twelfth century, when the citizenry reorganised a civic government partially independent of the Papacy.  In ancient Roman times the principal builings of the Capitoline faced east, overlooking the Forum. The main approaches to the Hill were also from the east. By the middle Ages, the situation radically changed. Stairs from the western side, that is from the <span class="italic">abitato</span>, became the main entrance to the Hill. (Krautheimer 285-286). The piazza was thus reoriented from the ancient Roman Forum to the medieval city, which echoes its new governmental and commercial functions, as it housed the city's main market. This reorientation is often erroneously entirely attributed to Michelangelo's renovations, which accentuated it.</p>
           
           <p>Michelangelo would transform the Hill even further in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, famously creating the trapezoidal space that is Piazza del Campidoglio, renovating <a href="senatorio.html">Palazzo Senatorio</a>, creating through renovation and new building the mirroring façades of <a href="conservatori.html">Palazzo dei Conservatori</a> and <a href="nuovo.htm">Palazzo Nuovo</a>, and designing the iconic oval pavement. The medieval fabric Michelangelo was working with was a dilapidated one (Ackerman 144), and his commission by Pope Paul III Farnese to renovate the site had aesthetic as well as political considerations.  The commission, generally dated to December 1437 (Ackerman 142), was a year after Holy Roman Emperor Charles V ceremoniously entered Rome in triumphal procession after the Conquest of Tunis in 1535. The lack of a suitable imperial access and the bad conditions of the buildings and urban spaces on a site of such ancient grandeur reportedly caused the Pope embarrassment and motivated him to commission its transformation (Ackerman 152).</p>
               
               <p>The project would not be completed until the mid-16th century, almost a century after Michelangelo's death, and some elements of his design, such as the pavement design, would not be completed until the twentieth century (Ackerman 142-145).</p>
