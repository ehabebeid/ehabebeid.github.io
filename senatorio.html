           <h1 class="w3-text">Palazzo del Senatore</h1>
           <p> The <span class="bold">Palazzo Senatorio</span> or <span class="bold">Palazzo del Senatore </span> (English: <span class="italic">Senatorial Palace</span> or <span class="italic">Palace of the Senator</span>) houses the local government of the city of Rome, and forms the south-eastern edge of the Piazza del Campidoglio. It is built atop the <a href="tabularium.html">Tabularium</a>.</p>
           
           <h3 class="w3-text">The Medieval Period: From the Senate to the Senator</h3>
           
           <p>The Middle Ages saw a surge in interest in Roman antiquity and in the political revival of the Republic. An urban revolt in 1443-44 nominally declared Republican governance by the Senate and People of Rome (Latin: <span class="italic">Senatus Populusque Romanus</span>), abbreviated as 'SPQR' (Krautheimer 197).  revolt's ideological underpinnings were not only to restore the Senate as an institution, but also to "rebuild the Capitol... and to reform the order of knights" (Krautheimer 286). Only six years later, in 1450, a Senate palace was installed on its present site, as a tangible, political symbol of the city's freedom (Krautheimer 195-197).</p>
           
           <p>One may wonder why the palace's name refers to a single senator as opposed to the Senate: the Medieval Senate gradually dissolved into a single senator, who was entrusted with running the city, and after whom the Palace was renamed.</p>
           
           <p>The relationship between the fortress-mansion built atop the <a href="tabularium.html">Tabularium</a> by the Corsi clan (as the building directly preceding the Senator's Palace on the same site) and Palazzo Senatorio is not entirely clear. Krautheimer presents two possibilities: the building may have been new, making use of spolia from both the Tabularium and the Corsi building; it could have also been simply a renaming of the same structure and its adaptation for a different function, a ubiquitous theme in the history of the Hill. Krautheimer separately notes a heightened architectural awareness of antiquity during this period in Rome, but a lack of evidence for the application of such awareness in the design of the medieval senatorial palace (197). This could lend support to the re-purposing as opposed to the reconstruction hypothesis.</p>
           
           <h3 class="w3-text">Michaelangelo's Palazzo Senatorio</h3>
           <p>Following Pope Paul III Farnese's commission of Michelangelo to redesign the site in late 1437 (Ackerman 142), it was imperative to restore the Senatorial palace. Michelangelo's redesign for it favoured a strong central axis and bilateral symmetry, moving its medieval tower to its centre, and designing double outer staircases.</p> <p> These staircases, though theorised by previous artists, were the first of its kind to actually be incorporated into a palace façade (Ackerman 153). They solved several problems: they gave direct access to the great hall on the <span class="italic">piano nobile</span>, saved space, and composed a great location to install the two reclining river god statues, which had been previously in front of the <a href="conservatori.html">Palazzo dei Conservatori</a>.</p>
           
           <p>Michelangelo's design, coupled with the piazza's design and the placement of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in its centre, provided a strong axis of approach as one climbs the hill through his cordonata. Through using the same type of colossal pilasters used in Palazzo dei Conservatori, it favours much of the classical language which he used to inspire grandeur. However, its use is primarily ornamental, as it is applied largely to the façade of the new Senatorial Palace. The Palace thus retains much of its medieval structures which were intact, which allows Michelangelo to work within the restricted and restricting budget imposed by the Pope and the Conservators (Ackerman 157, 159), though his emphasis on axiality (for example in the building of a new campanile) was costly (Ackerman 145). </p>
