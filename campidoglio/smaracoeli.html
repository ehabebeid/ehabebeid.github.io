           <h1 class="w3-text">Santa Maria in Aracoeli</h1>
           
         <p>The <span class="bold">Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli</span> is the designated church of the city council of Rome. The site which Santa Maria in Aracoeli currently occupies forms part of the ancient <span class="italic">Arx</span>, and is the traditional site ascribed to the Temple of Juno Moneta and perhaps the <span class="italic">auguraculum</span> (Coarelli 38). The church is built on the foundations of a Byzantine abbey on the site in 574, which in turn may have been built on the sites of the temple and the seat of the augurs. Krautheimer posits that Santa Maria in Capitolio, the early medieval predecessor to Santa Maria in Aracoeli which has been on the site since at least the eighth century, was built using spolia from the ruins of the Temple of Juno Moneta (285).</p>
           
        <p>By the twelfth century, the city’s most important market was held on and around the Capitoline, and a papal bull by Antipope Anacletus II refers to the space in front and below Santa Maria in Capitolio as its primary site. Since this space of the historic <span class="italic">Arx</span> was accessible from the western side (around the site of the modern-day Victor Emmanuel Monument), the bull is documentation of the reorientation of the Hill towards the <span class="italic">abitato</span> as opposed to overlooking the Roman Forum (Krautheimer 286-287). Documentation also exists of for the monumental staircase from the <span class="italic">abitato</span> to the church (adjacent to Michelangelo's cordonata), built in 1348 as a thanksgiving offering for deliverance from a plague (Claridge 234).</p>
           
        <p>The market reportedly turned the church into the religious centre of the city. Santa Maria in Capitolio was rebuilt in the mid-twelfth century, and was subsequently given its modern name, while its modern façade dates to the early fourteenth century (Claridge 234).</p>
           
        <p>The church is notable for the assortment of eleven pairs of ancient spolia columns in its central Basilican nave, some of which are of Aswan granite. Into the thirteenth and fourteenth century, the church’s design resisted gothic elements and retained its strong Basilican plan (Krautheimer 175). </p>
           
        <p>It is likewise notable for its ceiling, which was elaborately decorated after the church hosted Marcantonio Colonna's victory celebrations after the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, in which the Holy League defeated the Ottoman Navy fleet. To mark this occasion, the ceiling was gilded and painted after the battle to thank the Virgin Mary for the victory (Russo 43-44).</p>
